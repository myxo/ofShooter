# ofShooter

This is a simple top-down shooter game made with [openFrameworks (0.9.3)](http://openframeworks.cc/) and [Box2D](https://github.com/erincatto/Box2D). Make sure you've installed them. 

 Basically it's not a real game, it's just study project. So don't be serious about it. 

 For some reasone openFrameworks makefiles don't set c++14 standard if gcc<=4.8, so check your gcc version (or edit OF linux Makefile).
